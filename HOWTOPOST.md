How To Post:

1. Go to _posts

2. Create new file

3. Name file in format below
YYYY-MM-DD-NAMEOFPOST.markup
If it is not markup or is not in that format, there may be problems.

4. Paste this into file
"---
layout: post
title:  "Name of post"
date:   2016-07-18 20:18:44 -0400
categories: jekyll update
---"

Note: Do not edit anything, including date. The only field that should be edited is the title. Remove quotation marks from beginning and end of the pasted command.

5. Then you can begin to type whatever you would like to include in your post.

6. Commit changes.
